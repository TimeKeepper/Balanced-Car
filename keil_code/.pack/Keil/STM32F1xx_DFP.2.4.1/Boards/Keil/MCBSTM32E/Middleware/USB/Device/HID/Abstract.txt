This is an HID example that demonstrates Human Interface Device (HID)
on USB Device.

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/USB/html/dev_hid_tutorial.html

Board:                  Keil 'MCBSTM32E'
Microcontroller:        ST   'STM32F103'
Clock Settings:         XTAL   =  8 MHz
                        CPUCLK = 72 MHz
                        USBCLK = 48 MHz
User Interface:         inputs:  joystick
                        outputs: LEDs (PB8 .. PB13 and PB15)

The example demonstrates a Human Interface Device. The board LEDs and 
Joystick can be accessed from the PC through a custom 
HID Client Program (.\ARM\Utilities\HID_Client\Release\HIDClient.exe).

The program is available for target(s):

  - STM32F103 Flash: Downloads to and executes from internal Flash
