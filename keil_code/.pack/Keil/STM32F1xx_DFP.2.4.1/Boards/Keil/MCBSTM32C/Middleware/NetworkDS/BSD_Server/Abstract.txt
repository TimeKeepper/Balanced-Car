This program is a BSD_Server example running on Network Dual Stack.
It is used to serve LED control requests received from the client.

In order to run this example, you need to use auto-assigned IPv6 address
or set IPv4 address to match your local area network.

To test this example, run windows application "LEDSwitch.exe" on your PC.
Enter the IP address, server port and select the transfer protocol TCP or UDP.
When you change the value of P2 in windows application, LED diodes on
evaluation board should light accordingly.

The same example can be tested also with BSD_Client running on another
evaluation board. 

The BSD_Server example is available for one target:

STM32F107 Flash:
    Standalone application for MCBSTM32C Board.
    Program code is loaded into on-chip flash.
